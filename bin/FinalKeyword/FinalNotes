# Final DEFINITION
      It is used to restrict the user. 

#Final keyword can be used:

variable
method
class

# The final keyword can be applied with the variables, a final variable that have no value it is called blank final variable or 
uninitialized final variable. It can be initialized in the constructor only. 

# The blank final variable can be static also which will be initialized in the static block only. 

a) final variable:
====================
      If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of final variable(It will be constant).
      
Example of final variable:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There is a final variable speedlimit, we are going to change the value of this variable, but It can't be changed because final 
variable once assigned a value can never be changed.

class Bike9{  
 final int speedlimit=90;//final variable  
 void run(){  
  speedlimit=400;  
 }  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
 Bike9 obj=new  Bike9();  
 obj.run();  
 }  
}//end of class  

b) final method:
==================
If you make any method as final, you cannot override it.

c) final class:
=================
If you make any class as final, you cannot extend it.


# Is final method inherited?
Ans) Yes, final method is inherited but you cannot override it. For Example:

# What is blank or uninitialized final variable?
A final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as blank final variable.

If you want to create a variable that is initialized at the time of creating object and once initialized may not be changed, it is 
useful. For example PAN CARD number of an employee.

It can be initialized only in constructor.

class Student{  
int id;  
String name;  
final String PAN_CARD_NUMBER;  
...  
}  

# Can we initialize blank final variable?
Yes, but only in constructor. For example:


# static blank final variable
A static final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as static blank final variable. It can be initialized only in static block.

static blank final variable
A static final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as static blank final variable. It can be initialized only in static block.

Example of static blank final variable
class A{  
  static final int data;//static blank final variable  
  static{ data=50;}  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
    System.out.println(A.data);  
 }  
} 

Q) What is final parameter?
If you declare any parameter as final, you cannot change the value of it.

class Bike11{  
  int cube(final int n){  
   n=n+2;//can't be changed as n is final  
   n*n*n;  
  }  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
    Bike11 b=new Bike11();  
    b.cube(5);  
 }  
}  


Q) Can we declare a constructor final?
No, because constructor is never inherited.
