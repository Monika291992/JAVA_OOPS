Q: Do overriding method must have same return type (or subtype)?

From java 5 onwords, it is possible to have different return type for a overriding method in child class but child's return type should
be sub-type of parent's return type.It known as Covariant Return Type.

Covariant Return Type:

The covariant return type specifies that the return type may vary in the same direction as the subclass.

Before Java5, it was not possible to override any method by changing the return type. But now, since Java5, it is possible to 
override method by changing the return type if subclass overrides any method whose return type is Non-Primitive but it changes its 
return type to subclass type.

Overriding and Access modifier:

The access modifier for an overriding method can allow more, but not less, access than overridden method.

example: a protected instance method in the super class can be made public, but not private in the subclass. doing so, it will 
generate compile time error.

Can we override static method?
No, a static method cannot be overridden. It can be proved by runtime polymorphism,

Why can we not override static method?
It is because the static method is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with an object. Static belongs to the class area, and an instance belongs to the heap area.

Can we override java main method?
No, because the main is a static method.
