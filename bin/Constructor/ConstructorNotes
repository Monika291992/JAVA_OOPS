Constructor: is a block having same name as that of class name. 
++++++++++++++

1) constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. 
2) Constructor is used to initialize the object.
3) Constructor doesn't include return type or return any value even not void.
4) Constructor name should be same as class name.
5) Whenever object is created implicit or default constructor would be called.
6) A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized
7) We use the 4 type of access modifier private, protected, public or default constructor in Java.

Java Supports three types of constructors:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++	++

1) Default Constructor (No Args Constructor)(Created by Compiler) this is automatically created when not defined by user
2) User Defined Constructor(No Args Constructor)
3) Parameterized constructor

a) What is the purpose of a default constructor?
The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.

b) Why use the parameterized constructor?
The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. However, you can provide the same values 
also.

Constructor Overloading in Java
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In Java, a constructor is just like a method but without return type. It can also be overloaded like Java methods.

It is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists. They are arranged in a way that each 
constructor performs a different task. They are differentiated by the compiler by the number of parameters in the list and
their types.

Constructor Chaining
++++++++++++++++++++++

It is a process of calling one constructor from another constructor in the same class. Since constructor can only be called 
from another constructor, constructor chaining is used for this purpose.To call constructor from another constructor this 
keyword is used. This keyword is used to refer current object.

Private Constructors
++++++++++++++++++++++

In Java, we can create private constructor to prevent class being instantiate. It means by declaring a private constructor, 
it restricts to create object of that class.It is used to create singleton class. A class which can have only single object 
known as singleton class.

In private constructor, only one object can be created and the object is created within the class and also all the methods are 
static. An object can not be created if a private constructor is present inside a class. A class which have a private 
constructor and all the methods are static then it is called Utility class.

	
	//The purpose of constructor is to initialize the object of a class
    //while the purpose of a method is to perform a task by executing java code
    //Constructors cannot be abstract, final, static and synchronised while methods can be

	//Each time a new object is created at least one constructor will be invoked.

	//Car c = new Car()       //User defined constructor(No arg Constructor)
	//Car c = new Car(name); //Parameterized constructor invoked


	///Note: Default value of 
	                              String = null   string abc; int a;
									 int = 0 
public class DuoMainMethod(){

public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		System.out.println("1st String main method");
		DuoMainMethod dm = new DuoMainMethod(); // DuoMainMethod(); is constructor
		dm.main(10);
	}
		public static void main (int a){
		
		System.out.println("2nd int main method");
	}	
}


int a=10; // initialization
int a; //declaration
