# SUPER DEFINITION
	Super keyword is used to refer parent class, used to call superclass method and access superclass constructor

SUPER KEYWORD
	Super keyword is also a reference variable like this keyword
	Super Keyword refers to PARENT CLASS, while this keyword refers to CURRENT CLASS VARIABLE.
	

# SUPER KEYWORD USAGE
	
  1) super keyword used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
  2) super keyword used to invoke immediate parent class method.
  3) super() keyword is used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.
  
  NOTE: super() is added in each class constructor automatically by compiler if there is no super() or this().
  ***where super() is provided by the compiler implicitly.
  
  
  #The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class objects.
  #The super() in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class constructors
  
 
#There are few important points to note in this example:

1) super()(or parameterized super must be the first statement in constructor otherwise you will get the compilation error: 
“Constructor call must be the first statement in a constructor”

2) When we explicitly placed super in the constructor, the java compiler didn’t call the default no-arg constructor of parent class.
