#INHERITANCE DEFINITION: is used for code reusability
Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.

It is inheriting the properties of parent class into the child class.
OR
Inheritance is the procedure by which one object acquires all the properties behaviors of a parent object.

#INHERITANCE is used: 

a) code reusability
b) achieve method overriding (polymorphism)

Purpose of Inheritance
========================
It promotes the code reusabilty i.e the same methods and variables which are defined in a parent/super/base class can be used in the child/sub/derived class.
It promotes polymorphism by allowing method overriding.


Example, 
A child inherits the property of his/her parents.
With Inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class.

#The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class. The meaning of "extends" 
is to increase the functionality.

Every Airline needs to follow any of the 2 guideline from IntAirlines & all IndianAirlines guidelines

IntGuideline is PARENT class

IndianGuideline is also PARENT class

Note:**Multiple inheritance and Hybrid are not supported in Java through class.

class A{  
void msg(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
}  
class B{  
void msg(){System.out.println("Welcome");}  
}  
class C extends A,B{//suppose if it were  
   
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   C obj=new C();  
   obj.msg();//Now which msg() method would be invoked?  
}  
}  

#Some property doesn't inherit from parent class to child lass

a)Constructor never inherits from one class to another class.
b)Private method cann't inherit 

Note:**Every class has a super or say parent class ie. Object Class(but object class does not have any parent class)

Disadvantages of Inheritance
==============================
Main disadvantage of using inheritance is that the two classes (parent and child class) gets tightly coupled.

This means that if we change code of parent class, it will affect to all the child classes which is inheriting/deriving the parent class, and hence, it cannot be independent of each other.
